Cython - superset of Python, allows developers to write Python code that yields performance comparable to that of C.
<p>
It is a compiled language that is typically used to generate CPython extension modules. Annotated Python-like code is compiled to C & then automatically wrapped in interface code, producing extension modules that can be loaded & used by regular Python code using the import statement, but with significantly less computational overhead at run-time. Cython also facilitates wrapping independent C or C++ code into python-importable modules.
</p>
<p>
It is written in Python & C. Works on Windows, macOS, & Linux.
